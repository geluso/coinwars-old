This is intended to be a simulation of coin wars. Development will
be divided between a web-based version and a dedicated Android app.

06/15/2011 - Dawn of the Nickel
-------------------------------
Version 1! Creating initial physics. In this version you may launch
one nickel across the screen. Best yet: you can adjust several
simulation parameters!

New Features
------------
- one nickel
- the nickel moves in a straight line
- adjustable framerate, speed and acceleration

Todo
----
- Implement realistic physics; including friction and acceleration.
- Make the nickel a circle instead of a square
  - alternatively: advocate for changing actual nickels to squares.
- Add intro music.
- Add interactive mouse control.
- Implement trajectories.
- Implement simultaneous, multi-coin movement.
- Add pennies, quarters, dimes.
  - Include realistic weights and measurements.
- Add "fell off table" detection.
